The goal was to help an investment firm identify which industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new unicorns are emerging. By focusing on data from 2019, 2020 and 2021, I provided insights into which sectors are driving innovation and attracting the most investment.\n","\n","Using SQL, I identified the top-performing industries, calculated yearly growth metrics and analyzed the average valuations of new unicorns. The findings give a competitive edge to stakeholders by highlighting emerging opportunities in high-value sectors. This project is a great example of how technical analysis can translate into actionable business insights.\n","\n","Below is a description of the tables within the `unicorns` database:\n","\n","**dates**\n","| Column       | Description                                  |\n","|------------- |--------------------------------------------- |\n","| `company_id`   | A unique ID for the company.                 |\n","| `date_joined` | The date that the company became a unicorn.  |\n","| `year_founded` | The year that the company was founded.       |\n","\n","**funding**\n","| Column           | Description                                  |\n","|----------------- |--------------------------------------------- |\n","| `company_id`       | A unique ID for the company.                 |\n","| `valuation`        | Company value in US dollars.                 |\n","| `funding`          | The amount of funding raised in US dollars.  |\n","| `select_investors` | A list of key investors in the company.      |\n","\n","**industries**\n","| Column       | Description                                  |\n","|------------- |--------------------------------------------- |\n","| `company_id`   | A unique ID for the company.                 |\n","| `industry`     | The industry that the company operates in.   |\n","\n","**companies**\n","| Column       | Description                                       |\n","|------------- |-------------------------------------------------- |\n","| `company_id`   | A unique ID for the company.                      |\n","| `company`      | The name of the company.                          |\n","| `city`         | The city where the company is headquartered.      |\n","| `country`      | The country where the company is headquartered.   |\n","| `continent`    | The continent where the company is headquartered. |\n","\n","\n","Note: The SQL code for this project was executed in an online Datalab workbook.
