#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database with multiple tables containing customer sales data to quantify statistics and answer questions about customer and order data. 


# 1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(order_id) = 6 AND 
       order_id <> 'Order ID';

# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone' AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
       
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone' AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';



#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT JanSales.Product,
                JanSales.price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE price IN (
           SELECT MIN(JanSales.price) 
             FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
       

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product,
       sum(Quantity) * price AS Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY Product;
 


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,
       sum(Quantity) AS QuantitySold,
       sum(Quantity) * price AS Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
 GROUP BY Product;
 

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) AS NumCustomers,
       avg(Quantity * price) AS AvgSpent
  FROM BIT_DB.customers
       LEFT JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
 WHERE BIT_DB.FebSales.Quantity > 2 AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';
